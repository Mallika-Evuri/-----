🚀 End-to-End Data Analytics Project: SQL • EDA • Advanced Analytics

This project focuses on building complete Product and Customer analytical reports using SQL and extending them with structured Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Advanced Analytics. All SQL scripts are included in this repository.
🔍 Key SQL Deliverables
📦 Product Report
- Total orders, revenue, quantity sold, unique customers
- Product lifespan (months active)
- Performance segmentation → High / Mid / Low performers
- KPIs → Recency, Average Order Revenue (AOR), Average Monthly Revenue

👤 Customer Report
- Total purchases, revenue, quantity bought
- Product variety per customer
- Customer lifespan
- KPIs → Recency, Average Order Value (AOV), Monthly Spend
- Customer segmentation → VIP / Regular / New + Age groups

📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Key analyses performed:
- Database structure & relationship exploration
- Dimensions breakdown (category, age group, product type)
- Date trends & seasonality
- Measures exploration (big-number KPIs)
- Magnitude analysis (revenue/quantity contribution)
- Top-N & Bottom-N ranking

📈 Advanced Analytics
- Part-to-Whole Analysis → revenue & quantity share
- Segmentation Analysis → customer & product performance buckets
- Cumulative Trends → month-over-month growth
- Change-Over-Time → performance rise/decay, customer retention
- Performance Analysis → KPI comparison across segments
- Reporting Layer → reusable SQL views ready for BI dashboards
